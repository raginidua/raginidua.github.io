# About Me

Last year, I made the decision to leave my career as an investment banker to focus on learning opportunities which excite and inspire me.  Since my undergraduate degree, I have always loved Philosophy and later this year, I will be undertaking an MSc in Philosophy and Public Policy to explore this fascination further. My motivation to learn new things also led me to the Web Development Immersive course at GA.  There I found another great love - Coding.

After three months of intensive coding, I have found that, like Philosophy, Web Development is both art and science, and I have loved the varying ways in which it challenges me.  Unlike Philosophy however, Development is reassuringly concrete, and I have especially enjoyed using my creativity and problem-solving skills to create something tangible. I am currently looking for internship opportunities to consolidate my learning, and following my MSc I would like to work as a full-stack developer. I look forward to the opportunity to challenge myself to grasp new concepts, solve bigger, more complicated problems and work with a dynamic team to build products to make the world a better place.
